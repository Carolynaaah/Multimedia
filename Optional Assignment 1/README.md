# Optional Assignment 1

## Overview

This project implements a visual piano keyboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The keyboard includes correctly arranged white and black keys following the standard piano layout.

## Exercises

✅ Center the entire keyboard on the viewport  

✅ Add a border radius for keyboard, keypad and keys as appropriate, to create a more realistic look of the corners.  

✅ Modify the CSS so that the keypad always fills 100% of the available width in the keyboard container, regardless of screen resolution.  

✅ Add visual feedback when hovering over keys. White keys turn light gray (#f0f0f0) and black keys turn dark gray (#333).  

✅ Add smooth CSS transitions to all hover and active states (0.1s).  

✅ Add note labels to the keys in the correct chromatic order:  
`C C# D Eb E F F# G G# A Bb B`, repeated across the keyboard.  

✅ Add realistic shadows to create depth:  
- White keys have inset shadows  
- Black keys have subtle drop shadows  
- Hover creates a pressed-in effect
